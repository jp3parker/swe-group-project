* Decription: 
* In our program we are we made a website that will generate a image using text also known as ASCII art based on the users request.

* Technical Requirements
  * Api
  * postgres DB
  * Flask server
  * User login

* [Technologies, Frameworks and Libraries:](./requirements.txt)

  * Libraries
    * flask-login - to deal with session information, log in and verify users, etc.
    * SQL-alchemy - to connect with and interact with database
    * dot-env - to find ".env" file which contains API key.
    * requests - to request information from API's 
    * os - works in tandem with dot-env to find .env file
    * random - to generate a random number (to randomly choose a movie)
  * Other Technologies
    * postgresql - a type of database that holds user table and comments table
    * jinja2 - to structure html with variables
    * gunicorn - to deploy on fly.io
    * html - to structure web pages
    * css - to style web pages
    * python - to code with flask / logic / API's / etc.

* APIs:
  * [Google Custom Search](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/)
    * To fetch images that user searches from google images
    
* Thing learned
  * How to deal with the google custom search api. It's super userful and (in hindsight) pretty easy to use after setting up.
  * We learned how to deal with fly better.
  
* Wanted to learn
  * How to make the website more professional looking
  * How to make the pictures look more realistic in ascii form.
